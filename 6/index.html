            'bout my papes baked potato on that Draco
            New bandana on my face.</p>
        <p class="content">Sometimes I take all the shine
            Talk like I drank all the wine
            Years ahead but way behind
            I'm on one, two, three, four, five
            No half-truths, just naked minds
            Caught between space and time
            This not what we had in mind
            But maybe some day.</p>
